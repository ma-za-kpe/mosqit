# Privacy Policy for Mosqit

**Last Updated**: October 2024

## Overview

Mosqit is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect any data.**

Mosqit operates entirely on your local device. All processing, analysis, and storage happens locally in your browser.

## What Stays on Your Device

- All console logs and error messages
- AI analysis results
- Error patterns and debugging history
- User preferences and settings
- Stack traces and debugging information

## AI Processing

Mosqit uses Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model which runs entirely on your device. This means:

- No data is sent to external AI services
- No API calls to cloud services
- All AI processing happens locally
- Your code never leaves your machine

## Third-Party Services

Mosqit does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Permissions Used

- **activeTab**: To capture console output from the current tab

All permissions are used solely for debugging functionality and do not transmit data externally.

All data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API:

- Data remains on your device
- Clearing browser data removes all Mosqit data
