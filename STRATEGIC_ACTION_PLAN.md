# Mosqit Strategic Action Plan
## Pre-Launch Critical Path (Chrome AI Challenge 2025)

**Deadline**: October 31, 2025
**Status**: Pre-Launch Phase
**Goal**: Chrome AI Challenge Finalist + 10K Installs in 3 Months

---

## Executive Summary

Based on competitive analysis, Mosqit has a **unique market position** as the only developer-console-first AI debugging tool with on-device processing. However, **current positioning creates confusion** by leading with visual bug reporting features.

**Critical Action**: Rebrand as a developer productivity tool (AI console) with visual debugging as a bonus feature.

---

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1-2) 🚨

### Priority 1: Fix Chrome AI Detection Bug
**Status**: 🔴 Blocking Launch
**Issue**: Currently using legacy Writer API instead of window.ai APIs
**Evidence**: Console shows `{legacyWriter: true}` instead of `{writer: true, prompt: true}`

**Location**: `src/extension/content/mosqit-content.js` lines 165-329

**Problem Code**:
```javascript
// Line 200: This check prevents window.ai.writer from being detected
if (!this.aiAvailable && typeof window.ai !== 'undefined' && window.ai?.writer) {
  // This is SKIPPED if Prompt API check sets aiAvailable to any value
}
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Remove `!this.aiAvailable` check on line 200
- [ ] Test all Chrome AI API detection paths:
  - window.ai.assistant (Prompt API)
  - window.ai.writer (Writer API)
  - window.ai.languageModel (Language Model API)
  - window.ai.summarizer (Summarizer API)
- [ ] Update priority order based on capabilities
- [ ] Test on Chrome 128, 131, 140+
- [ ] Add telemetry for which APIs are used

**Testing**:
```javascript
// Expected output after fix
window.mosqitLogger?.aiCapabilities
// Should show: {prompt: true, writer: true, summarizer: true}
// NOT: {legacyWriter: true}
```

**Assignee**: Core team
**Deadline**: Week 1
**Impact**: High - Using outdated APIs

---

### Priority 2: Reposition Marketing Materials
**Status**: 🟡 Urgent
**Issue**: Documentation positions Mosqit as visual bug reporter first, console tool second

and spend 5-30 minutes debugging or searching StackOverflow.

THE SOLUTION:
Mosqit uses Chrome's built-in AI to explain errors instantly (<100ms)
with actionable fix suggestions. All processing happens locally—no cloud,
no API costs, maximum privacy.

WHY CHROME AI?
• On-device processing (privacy-first)
• <100ms response time (faster than cloud APIs)
• Works offline
• Free to use (no API costs)

We're entering the Chrome AI Challenge 2025 and would love your feedback!

## Conclusion

**Mosqit has a unique market position** as the only developer-console-first AI debugging tool with on-device processing. Success depends on:

1. **Clear positioning** as a developer productivity tool (NOT a QA/visual reporter)
2. **Technical excellence** (fix AI bugs, optimize performance)
3. **Strong launch** (Product Hunt, Chrome Web Store, Chrome AI Challenge)
4. **Community building** (open source contributors, content marketing)
5. **Continuous innovation** (keep adding AI-powered features)

**The opportunity is real**. No competitor is doing on-device AI console analysis. Mosqit can own this category.

**The risk is confusion**. If Mosqit is positioned as a visual bug reporter, it will be compared to Marker.io/BugHerd and appear incomplete.

**The path forward is clear**: Double down on AI console. Make visual debugger a bonus. Win Chrome AI Challenge. Build community.

Let's buzz through those bugs. 🦟
