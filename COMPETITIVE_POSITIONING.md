## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Mosqit is like Chrome DevTools Console Insights, but instant and private. We use on-device Gemini Nano to analyze console errors in under 100ms—no cloud, no waiting, no data leaving your browser. It's the fastest, most private AI debugging experience available."

### Feature Pitch (60 seconds)

"Chrome DevTools has Console Insights that sends your errors to Google's cloud Gemini—great for some use cases, but slow and privacy-concerning for sensitive codebases. Mosqit runs Gemini Nano locally in your browser, analyzing errors in <100ms with zero data leaving your machine. It works offline, globally, without authentication. Plus, it's automatic—every error gets analyzed without clicking. Perfect for developers who need instant insights without compromising privacy."

### Target Audience Messages

**Solo Developers:**
"Debug faster without sending your code to the cloud. Works offline on planes, trains, coffee shops."

**Enterprise Developers:**
"Analyze proprietary code errors without data leaving your network. GDPR/compliance-friendly on-device AI."

**International Developers:**
"No US-only restrictions. Works globally, any age, no Google sign-in required."

**Privacy-Conscious Developers:**
"100% on-device processing. Your code never touches external servers."

## Competitive Response Scenarios

### Q: "How is this different from Chrome DevTools Console Insights?"

**A:** "Console Insights is great, but it sends your code to Google's cloud—which takes seconds and raises privacy concerns. Mosqit uses Gemini Nano locally in your browser for <100ms analysis with zero data leaving your machine. Plus, Mosqit is automatic (no clicking) and works offline globally."

### Q: "Why not just use Chrome DevTools?"

**A:** "If you're in the US, over 18, comfortable sending your code to Google, and don't mind clicking for each error, Console Insights works well. Mosqit is for developers who need instant analysis, value privacy, work offline, or are outside the US."

### Q: "What about Sentry or other error monitoring tools?"

**A:** "Those are excellent cloud platforms for production monitoring across your team. Mosqit is for real-time debugging in development—instant, local analysis while you're coding. Different use case: DevTools vs production monitoring."
