# Privacy Policy for Mosqit Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Mosqit is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension operates with a **privacy-first** design, using Chrome's built-in AI capabilities to ensure all data processing happens locally on your device.

## Data Collection

### What We DON'T Collect
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Source code or debugging data
- ❌ Error messages or stack traces
- ❌ User interactions or behavior
- ❌ Analytics or telemetry
- ❌ Any data whatsoever

### What Stays on Your Device
- ✅ All error analysis
- ✅ Debugging context
- ✅ User preferences
- ✅ Pattern detection data
- ✅ AI processing

## How Mosqit Works

1. **Local Processing Only**: All AI analysis uses Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model, which runs entirely on your device
2. **No External APIs**: The extension never makes requests to external servers for analysis
3. **No Data Transmission**: Your code, errors, and debugging information never leave your computer
4. **Temporary Memory**: Debugging context is only kept in memory during your session and cleared when you close the tab

## Chrome's Built-in AI

Mosqit leverages Chrome's Gemini Nano model which:
- Runs completely offline on your device
- Does not send data to Google or any other servers
- Requires explicit user permission to enable
- Can be disabled at any time through Chrome settings

## Permissions Explained

- **What it doesn't do**: Does not collect or transmit any website data

### Storage Permission

- **What it does**: Stores settings in your browser's local storage
- **What it doesn't do**: Does not sync or transmit data
