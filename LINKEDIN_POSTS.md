## Post 1: Project Announcement
---
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: **Mosqit** - an AI-powered debugging assistant for Chrome!

🎯 Built for the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025, Mosqit brings Android Logcat-style debugging to the web, powered by Chrome's local Gemini Nano model.

Key features:
✅ Real-time error analysis (<100ms)
✅ Privacy-first (all processing on-device)
✅ Works offline with 2GB local AI model
✅ Smart fallback for non-AI environments

After 25+ hours of development and overcoming GPU requirements, content script isolation, and CSP challenges, I'm proud to have a fully working Chrome extension that actually makes debugging easier!

Tech stack: TypeScript, Chrome Extension Manifest V3, Chrome Writer API, Gemini Nano

## Post 2: Technical Achievement
---
🎉 Achievement Unlocked: Successfully integrated Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano) into a production Chrome Extension!

After wrestling with:
- 🔧 Chrome flags that wouldn't activate
- 📦 A 2GB model download (25 minutes!)
- 🚧 Content script isolation requiring MAIN world scripts
- 🛡️ CSP violations needing creative solutions

The result? **Mosqit** now provides intelligent, context-aware error analysis directly in your browser - no cloud required!

The Writer API provides structured debugging output that actually helps fix errors, not just log them.

Special shoutout to the Chrome AI Early Preview Program for making this possible!

## Post 3: Hackathon Journey
---
🏆 Submitting to Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025!

**Mosqit** started as an idea: "What if debugging was as smart as Android Logcat?"

The journey:
📍 Day 1: Discovered Chrome AI APIs exist
📍 Day 2: Fought with content script isolation
📍 Day 3: Implemented fallback analysis for accessibility
📍 Day 4: Integrated Writer API for production-ready error analysis

The result: Real-time, AI-powered debugging that works offline and respects privacy.

Most proud of: Building comprehensive fallback mechanisms so Mosqit works for everyone, not just those with high-end GPUs.

## Post 4: Lessons Learned
---
💡 Key lessons from building an AI-powered Chrome Extension:

1️⃣ **Not everyone has a GPU** - Always build fallbacks
2️⃣ **Local AI is the future** - 2GB download for lifetime privacy
3️⃣ **Chrome's Writer API > Prompt API** for structured output
4️⃣ **MAIN world scripts** are essential for console override
5️⃣ **Test everything** - Created 50+ test buttons to verify APIs

Mosqit now analyzes JavaScript errors in real-time using on-device AI, providing actionable fixes without sending data to the cloud.

The future of web development is intelligent, private, and local.

🎥 Mosqit in Action!

Watch as Chrome's built-in AI analyzes JavaScript errors in real-time:

TypeError: "Cannot read null"
→ AI: "Add conditional rendering with default values"

ReferenceError: "fetchData undefined"
→ AI: "Check imports and function declarations"

Network Error: "Promise rejection"
→ AI: "Add .catch() handler with error logging"

All processed locally on your device in <100ms using Gemini Nano!
